# Milestone Project: ConferenceFriends

This is a milestone project in Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI course. The project creates an iOS app that allows the user to document friends met at a conference event. The app generates a QR code that the user can share with other friends to quickly get added into their friends list.
